# 2.3.2

The v2.3.2 release adds a new feature.

## New feature

 * Add ability to use WFS DWITHIN query for feature info on map click (#827)

#### WFS DWITHIN query
If you want to use the new WFS DWITHIN queries you will need to configure your layer with the following metadata:

```
  ...
  id: 'my_layer',
  metadata: {
    'bnd:queryable': true,
    'bnd:geometry-name': 'the_geom',
    'bnd:query-type': 'WFS',
    'bnd:query-endpoint': '/geoserver/wfs',
    'bnd:query-params': {foo: 'bar'},
  },
  ...
```

The query params is an optional object with key value pairs, that will get appended to the request.

This functionality is particularly useful on vector tile layers, since for those you cannot get the full geometry for display, since geometries will be clipped at tile boundaries, or not given back at all. At this point, it's only implemented in the OpenLayers based Map component.
